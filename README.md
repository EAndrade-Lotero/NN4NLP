# 🧠 Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing (NN4NLP)

Auxiliary tools and demonstrations for applying neural network architectures to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including embedding, classification, and sequence modeling.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository offers a collection of resources designed to facilitate the application of neural networks in NLP. It encompasses:

- **Embedding Techniques**: Implementations and demonstrations of word and sentence embeddings.
- **Classification Models**: Tools for text classification tasks.
- **Sequence Modeling**: Resources for handling sequential data in NLP. Checkout the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/EAndrade-Lotero/NN4NLP/notebooks/)

The goal is to provide modular and reusable components that can be integrated into various NLP projects.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Examples

Word Embedding: Learn how to generate and visualize word embeddings.

Text Classification: Build and evaluate a text classification model.

Sequence Modeling: Implement sequence models for tasks like language modeling or machine translation.

Each example is provided as a Jupyter notebook for ease of understanding and experimentation.
